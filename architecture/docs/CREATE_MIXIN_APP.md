## Steps to Create a New Mixin App

1. **Log in to the Dashboard**

Go to the [Mixin Developer Dashboard](https://developers.mixin.one/dashboard) and log in using your credentials.

2. **Create a New Application**

Click `Create App`, fill in the required fields (application name, description, logo, and permissions), and submit the form.

3. **Retrieve Configuration Data**

After creating the application, you will see a generated application detail page. You will need to copy and save the following keys and IDs provided by Mixin:

```
MIXIN_APP_ID=
MIXIN_SESSION_ID=
MIXIN_SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY=
MIXIN_SESSION_PRIVATE_KEY=
MIXIN_SPEND_PRIVATE_KEY=

```

4. **Configure Your Application**

Place these values into your application environment configuration (`.env` or relevant configuration file).
